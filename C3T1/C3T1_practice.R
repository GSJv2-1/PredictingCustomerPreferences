#Creating Testing and Training Sets

#Linear Regression Model using the linear model function

summary(cars_lm) #Multiple R-squared- How well the regression line fits the data (1 means itâ€™s a perfect fit).
#p-value - Tells you how much the Independent Variable/Predictor affects the Dependent Variable/Response/. 
#A p-value of more than 0.05 means the Independent Variable has no effect on the Dependent Variable; 
#less than 0.05 means the relationship is statistically significant.

#Predictions - predict the distance through the speed of the cars
